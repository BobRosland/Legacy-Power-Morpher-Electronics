# Legacy-Power-Morpher-Electronics
A project I started years ago to replace the electronics in the Legacy Power Morpher. Feel free to use whatever files are found here for whatever projects you want. I don't
own the source audio anyway so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

These are pretty raw. There was some editing and mxing done to these, but they all end pretty abruptly and could use a fade in and out.
